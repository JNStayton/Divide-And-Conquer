### Divide and Conquer

This exercise consists of several problems to implement the divide-and-conquer search algorithm. Each file includes the description of what the function should solve, and has comments with how each function works.
**The time complexity for each of these functions should be O(log(n))**

To run the tests for these, make sure to have jest installed, and run the following commands in the terminal:

1. `jest count-zeroes`
2. `jest find-floor`
3. `jest find-rotated-index`
4. `jest find-rotation-count`
5. `jest sorted-frequency`
